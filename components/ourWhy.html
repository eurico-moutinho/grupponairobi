      <p class="lang" data-key="why_p1">In Kenya, thousands of children are denied an education simply because their families cannot afford school fees.</p>
      <p class="lang" data-key="why_p2">Inspired by Sister Hitha, a close partner who helped us build a school in Kerala, India, we are launching a new mission:
        to create a six-classroom primary school in Ngunga Parish, Machakos District, near the Tanzanian border — a region deeply impacted by poverty and lack of infrastructure.</p>
      <p class="lang" data-key="why_p3">Education opens the door to opportunity. It lifts children out of poverty, strengthens local communities, and reduces the need for risky migration.</p>
      <p class="highlight-text lang" data-key="why_p4">You can be that change.</p>
